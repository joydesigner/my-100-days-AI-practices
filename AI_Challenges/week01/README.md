# Linear Regression Model Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement a simple linear regression model using the PyTorch framework, minimize the loss function through the gradient descent algorithm, and predict a linear relationship. The main purpose of the project is to help beginners understand the basic principles and implementation process of gradient descent.

## Project Goals
- Implement a simple linear regression model using PyTorch.
- Minimize the mean square error loss function through the gradient descent algorithm.
- Generate simple linear data for training and testing models.
- Visualize data and training results.

## Environment Preparation
Make sure you have installed Python and PyTorch. If not, you can refer to the official documentation of PyTorch to install it:
```sh
pip install torch
